The vi text editor is available on all unix and linux systems (from desktop
machines to high performance computers). This course will introduce you to the
vi editor, including some advanced
features.

There are also other editors that you may wish to learn, such as emacs and
editors that come with IDEs (integrated development environments)
such as PyCharm and VS Code.
